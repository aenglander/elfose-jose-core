# JOSE Core
JOSE Core is the core library for JSON Object Signing and Encryption as part
of the Extensible Libraries for Object Signing and Encryption. This library
provides the reusable pieces and extensible types for cryptography library
based implementations.

## About ELfOSE
Extensible Libraries for Object Signing and Encryption, or ELfOSS, was created
to provide a core library from which cryptography library based implementations
could be implemented. Every cryptography library has its own strengths and
weaknesses. Most object signing and encryption libraries are tied to a single
cryptography library for ease of development or personal preference. Often
times a particular cryptography library lacks a feature you need such as a
particular algorithm for signing or encryption or is not compliant with a
security standard. Sometimes, you just have a very strong preference for one
library over the other, ELfOSS hopes to meet all those needs by providing a
common interface for object signing and encryption standards to build on.
